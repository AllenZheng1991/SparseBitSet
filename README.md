SparseBitSet
============

### Preface
You know how the internets are; a link that exists today is gone tomorrow.  A while ago I had a need for an efficient
Sparse BitSet in Java, and found a presentation and code by Dr. Bruce K. Haddon.  Going back later, I found the links I had used to find it were dead.  Some internet sleuthing later, I found and contacted Dr. Haddon and he was kind enough to send me the presentation again.  I have created this project to capture the code for others, as well as the presentation.  I can take credit for neither.
